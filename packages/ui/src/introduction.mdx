# Nugudi Design System

**A comprehensive design system for building consistent, scalable user interfaces**

## Overview

The Nugudi Design System provides a unified set of design tokens, components, and patterns that enable teams to build cohesive user experiences across all products. Built with React 19 and Vanilla Extract, it emphasizes performance, accessibility, and developer experience.

### Key Features

- **Type-safe CSS-in-JS** with Vanilla Extract for zero-runtime styling
- **Component Library** with comprehensive Storybook documentation
- **Design Tokens** for consistent theming across applications
- **Chromatic Integration** for automated visual regression testing
- **Tree-shakeable** exports for optimal bundle sizes

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add @nugudi/nugudi-ui

# Import components
import { Button, Typography } from '@nugudi/nugudi-ui'
import '@nugudi/nugudi-ui/style.css'
```

### Prerequisites

- React 19.0.0 or higher
- React DOM 19.0.0 or higher

## Architecture

### Package Structure

```
@nugudi/nugudi-ui
├── components/      # UI components
│   ├── button/
│   └── typography/
├── foundations/     # Design tokens & primitives
│   ├── color/
│   ├── typography/
│   └── icons/
└── utils/          # Shared utilities
```

### Core Components

#### Available Now

- **Button** - Primary interactive element with multiple variants
- **Typography** - Text components with semantic HTML support

#### Foundations

- **Color System** - Semantic color tokens for consistent theming
- **Typography Scale** - Modular type system based on design principles
- **Icons** - SVG-based icon system with React components

## Development

### Scripts

```bash
# Start Storybook development server
pnpm dev:storybook

# Build the component library
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type checking
pnpm check-types

# Deploy to Chromatic
pnpm deploy:chromatic
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests** with Vitest and @vitest/browser
- **Visual Regression** via Chromatic integration
- **Accessibility Testing** with Storybook's a11y addon

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency First** - Every component follows established patterns
2. **Performance Optimized** - Zero-runtime CSS, tree-shakeable exports
3. **Developer Experience** - Full TypeScript support, comprehensive docs
4. **Accessibility Built-in** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as baseline
